# SQL - Installation and Importing:
*These instructions are for Windows OS only*

<details>
<summary> Installing the program </summary>
<ol>
<li> Download and install SSMS 19.1; it will be your SQL program: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver16#download-ssms </li>
<li> You still need a server. Download and install the "Express" server for SQL: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads </li>
<li> Launch SQL Server Management Studio 19 </li>
<li> Make sure: </li>
<ul>
<li>Server type: Database Engine</li>
<li>Server name: should be set to your PC name \SQLEXPRESS; i.e., MattPC\SQLEXPRESS</li>
<li>Authentication: Windows Authentication</li>

 * To fix the common server error go to "Options" > "Connection Properties," check the "Trust server certificate" box, and then click "Connect" at the bottom.
</ul>
</ol>
 
  *Now you're up and running, great job!*
  
</details>  

<details>
<summary> Database time </summary>
 
 *We are logged into SSMS already*
 
<ol>
 <li> To your left is the "Object Explorer; this is our nexus.</li>
 <li> Right-click on the "Databases" folder and create a "New Database." Name it "SQL Case Study 1." Click OK.</li>
 <li> Now right-click your new database > Tasks > Import Flat File </li>
 <li> A pop up window appears; click Next. Browse your hard drive for the CSV files folder we made earlier.</li>
 <li> A preview appears; do a quick check that all the column names are as intended. Then click Next.</li>
 <li> Here is where you can assign any columns to be primary keys, which prevents duplicate data, enhances queries, and benefits your ability to establish relationships. All that, and it serves no purpose for this situation 🤣. </li>
 <li> Here is also where you can "Allow nulls" essentially saying get this column in the database at any cost of integrity. <em>A selection we want to use sparingly as good practice </em>. </li>
<li> Our new tables are stored inside the "Tables" folder, which is inside our "SQL Case Study 1" database. </li>
 </ol>
 
 ## Troubleshooting time:
 <ol>
 <li> Ironically, column "start_station_name" <em>may</em> have too many characters for proper processing. If you have that situation. We have two options:</li>
 <ol>
  <li>Edit the CSV files to fit the nvarchar length requirements, which would take ages to due to with size of the CSVs.</li>
<li> Change the "start_station_name" data type to nvarchar(100) allowing us 100 characters.</li>
 </ol>
 <li>Column errors for "start_lat" and "end_lat": They need their data type changed from float to decimal(18, 10). 
 
  <details>
<summary>Explanation</summary>
  
<em> A float in Computer Science is a data type composed of a number that is not an integer because it includes a fraction represented in decimal format. However, it is also subject to something called "Floating impercision" which leads to "Integer Overflow". Aka after a certain decimal place, the computer does its best to replicate the actual numbers, but because a float is stored as 32 bits, aka 4 bytes of memory, 
 The data type runs out of memory, and because of how binary works, truncation happens again, aka you need NULL in your column without a data type swap.
 
I learned all of this in Harvard's CS50 course. My notes on the subjects of: 
 <ul>
  <li>Floating Point Imprecision</li>
 <li>Integer Overflow</li> 
  <li>Truncation</li> 
  </ul>
 
 can be found at the <strong>bottom</strong> of week 1's Notes.md file 😄
 
I highly recommend the free course to anyone intrigued by Computer Science! </em>

<em> We managed to load LARGE CSV files into SQL without allowing NULLs. Any employer would be proud of our efforts! 💪 </em>

# The SQL Process - Query Time:

* Once all 12 CSV files are loaded into your database, refresh your "Object Explorer" by pressing F5 or clicking the reset button in the tab at the top.
* Now it's time to queue. Press CTRL+N or click "New Query" just below the "Tools" tab at the top of the application. 
* One important note: Since we're dealing with .CSV files that start with a number, we need to always use [] square brackets around our file names, i.e., [202205-divvy-tripdata].
* Skim around above for SQL syntax that is applicable to the case study.
* Honestly, I thought of everything I could and, of course, answered stakeholder queries. I gathered over 25 inquiries and deleted a few silly ones.
* I thought of making a walkthrough for SQL syntax, but I'm not sure what that would look like. An explanation of what every keyword does? <em> that seems like a waste of everyones time. just go here [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/). </em>
* The sytnax along with the results are all listed in every .sql file. Take a look and try them out, or make your own!


# Fin
Per stakeholder request: 
* We imported the previously cleaned CSV files **without allowing NULLs** by changing data types in SQL 💪.
* We utilized deep SQL queries using CASE, CREATE, DISTINCT, JOIN, SUBQUERY, UNION, and so on while showing our work.
* We answered every possible question using data-driven decision-making that is ripe for summary visualizations.
