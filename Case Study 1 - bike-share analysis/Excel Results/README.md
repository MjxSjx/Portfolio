# The Excel Process: From Dirty To Clean:

* Download the newest annual data from here: https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html.
* Unzip all 12 files and place them in a specfically named folder for userablity and transferablity.
* Place that folder in a location relevent to the material.


### *If* the sheets have any missing data, remove the entire row.

<summary>Cleaning the data</summary>
  
*This process is per situation and normally stakeholders are involved with the decison on what to do with empty cells.*

<ol>  
<li>  Select all fields (including column names) by clicking and dragging over all columns OR by clicking the upmost upper-left of the field section of the sheet. Aka above row 1 and to the left of column A.</li>
<li> After selecting all fields hold down CTRL+G a "Go To" window popups > Select "Special" > Click "Blanks". This may take literal minutes to finish running.</li>
  
<li>Once finished I scroll down until I see a highlight cell or chunk of cells, right click when hovered over a highlighted cell and choose "Delete" then choose "Entire row" (You may get a warning; hit OK) THis to will take actual minutes and you sheet may freeze, that's normal.</li>
<li>Sadly, you must run all of these steps twice:weary:.</li>
