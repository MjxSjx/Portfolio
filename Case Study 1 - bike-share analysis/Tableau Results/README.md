I decided to focus my data visualization on the question assigned by the stakeholders.


I then asked myself:

In what ways can I compare the rider types?

* by total rides: annually with a filter toggling months per rider type.
* by rider length/duration: annually with a filter toggling months per rider type.
* by start locations: annually with a filter toggling months split per rider type.
* by end locations: annually with a filter toggling months split per rider type.
* What are the rental stats of each bike offered in percentage split between rider types annually with a filter toggling months.

Those five questions covered the entirety of all the other sub-questions I asked myself.
