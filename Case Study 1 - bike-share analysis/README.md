* [Case Study 1 - bike-share analysis](https://github.com/MjxSjx/Portfolio/blob/main/Case%20Study%201%20-%20bike-share%20analysis/Case%20Study%201%20-%20bike-share%20analysis.pdf)

## Excel: 
I cleaned the data, then combined it and created new columns. Most of the 12 sheets, totaling over 1 GB of data, were of no interest. I used pivot tables to sort, filter, and condense only the essential information, then generated graphs and pivot tables to achieve stakeholder deliverables. They are to be used in tandem with a presentation, as the information is too dense on one sheet. 

## SQL: 
I cleaned the data, documented the total number of rows, distinct values, minimum, maximum, and mean values of "ride_length" and "day_of_week" per sheet, and much more, then applied all 12 sheets together. I used JOIN statements to combine stakeholder-relevant data into one table. Created summary statistics, investigated trends purely based on data-driven information, and saved that information into a table. 

## R:
I imported the data. Made columns consistent and merged them into a single dataframe. Then I cleaned up and added data to prepare for analysis. Conducted aÂ descriptive analysis and exported a summary file for stakeholder deliverables. 

## Tableau:
I created a data visualization using Tableau. I focused my data viz on answering every possible question that branches from the initial stakeholder question: "How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?" I also linked my Rmd findings on my Tableau page at the bottom.
