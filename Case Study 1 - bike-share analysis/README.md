## Excel: 
I cleaned the data, then combined it and created new columns. Most of the 12 sheets, totaling over 1 GB of data, were of no interest. I used pivot tables to sort, filter, and condense only the essential information, which contains graphs and pivot tables per stakeholder deliverable. They are to be used in tandem with a presentation, as the information is too dense on one sheet.

## SQL: 
I cleaned the data, documented the total number of rows, distinct values, maximum, minimum, and mean values of "ride_length" and "day_of_week" per sheet, and then applied all 12 sheets together. I used JOIN statements to combine stakeholder-relevant data into one table. Created summary statistics, investigated trends purely on data-driven information, and saved that information into a table.
