## Excel: 
I cleaned the data, then combined it and created new columns. Most of the 12 sheets, totaling over 1 GB of data, were of no interest. I used pivot tables to sort, filter, and condense only the essential information, then generated graphs and pivot tables to achieve stakeholder deliverables. They are to be used in tandem with a presentation, as the information is too dense on one sheet. 

## SQL: 
I cleaned the data, documented the total number of rows, distinct values, minimum, maximum, and mean values of "ride_length" and "day_of_week" per sheet, and then applied all 12 sheets together. I used JOIN statements to combine stakeholder-relevant data into one table. Created summary statistics, investigated trends purely on data-driven information, and saved that information into a table. 

## R:
I imported the data. Made columns consistent and merged them into a single dataframe. Then I cleaned up and added data to prepare for analysis. Conducted a descriptive analysis and exported a summary file for stakeholder deliverables. 

## Tableau:
I created data visualization using Tableau. I focused my data viz on answering every possible question that branches from the intial assigned stakeholder question; “How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?”
