# R Studio
* Luckily, this is the easiest part; the instructions are dated but still helpful.
* In truth, it may be possible just by using R. However, I use the IDE RStudio and suggest you do the same.
* Here's the instructions: [R Script](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TTj5KNKf4BWvEORGm10oNbpwTRk1hamsWJGj6qRWpuI/edit)

## Installation
<details>
  <summary>Software</summary>
### Click here ➡️ [R](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/R-4.3.0-win.exe)

* I created an auto-download link because I find the CRAN website confusing 😵. 
* Keep in mind that R does not auto-update.
* Run through the setup, keeping all the default settings.

### Click here ➡️ [R Studio](https://download1.rstudio.org/electron/windows/RStudio-2023.06.0-421.exe)
* I created an auto-download link because why not.
* Keep in mind that RStudio does not auto-update, nor do the libraries. 
* Run through the setup, keeping all the default settings.
  
### Make sure you create a directory for your project
  * The far top-right has a tab just below the "Close tab" click it > New Project > name your directory and its location > Create Project.

  * To change RStudio to nightmode: Tools > Global Options > appearance > Editor theme > "Tomorrow Night" is my current selection.
  * I prefer this pane layout. I ask that you consider it yourself. To change it: View > Panes > Pane Layout However, it is all preference:

## Uploading 
* Note: The point of this set of instructions is to answer "In what ways do members and casual riders use Divvy bikes differently?". We can use R to answer other questions as well. 
* It is my opinion to save on typing you should consider copying the instructions listed at the top into a new R script.
* To do so: File tab > New File > R Script. Copy the instructions and paste them into your new script then: File tab > Save As > bike_riders.R (or whatever file name you like).
* 
* First we need to potentially install tidyverse, lubirdate and ggplot. Its likely you already have them and if you took the Coursera Google Data Analytics course and followed their instructions word for word you installed tidyverse like 15 times 🤣. 
* After install the tidyverse library you still need to load it. 
* Time to upload the CSV files we cleaned earlier.
