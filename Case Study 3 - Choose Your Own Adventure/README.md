# Introduction

For the third case study, you set out on an independent track and find your own data and question(s) to ask and answer. I decided to ask the question: Is unfettered capitalism eating itself?

I noticed:

* low fertility rates
* low migration rates
* Stagnant worker wages
* Yet higher than ever productivity

So I asked myself, <em>Is there a correlation?</em>
