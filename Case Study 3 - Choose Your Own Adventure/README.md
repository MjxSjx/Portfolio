# Introduction

I decided to ask the question: Is unfettered capitalism eating itself?

I noticed:

* low fertility rates
* low migration rates
* Stagnant worker wages
* Yet higher than ever productivity

So I asked myselfÂ <em>Is there a correlation?</em>

Capitalists need workers, yet we have a severe decline in population as wages continue to deviate from worker productivity.
