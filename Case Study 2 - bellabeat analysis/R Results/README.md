I used RPubs to publish my findings.

### I utilized <em> all 6 steps </em> of data analysis and also included:

* An introduction
  * Stating the purpose of the case study
    
* Identifying the problems
  * What the major problems are, and explain how I have analyzed the problem

* Solutions
  * A solution that would alleviate the problem
  
* Conclusion
  * A summary of key takeaways from all of the problem-solving I conducted, highlighting what I've learned from this
    
* Next steps
  * The best solution and proposed recommendations for the client or business to take
