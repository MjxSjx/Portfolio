# R
I started by <strong><em>asking</em></strong> the right questions. I then <strong><em>prepared</em></strong> by importing the data, inspecting it, and cleaning it. I then <strong><em>processed</em></strong> it by using summary and other functions, made columns consistent when applicable across different sheets, and merged them when applicable into a single dataframe. Then I <strong><em>analyzed</em></strong> the information and <strong><em>shared</em></strong> the results in R plot form. Finally, I <strong><em>acted</em></strong> by giving a conclusion and recommendations for stakeholder deliverables.
