# R
I started by <strong><em>asking</em></strong> the right questions. I then <strong><em>prepared</em></strong> by importing the data, inspecting it, and cleaning it. Then <strong><em>processed</em></strong> the data by using summary and other functions, made columns consistent when applicable across different sheets, and merged them when applicable into a single dataframe. Taking the time to <strong><em>analyze</em></strong> the information and <strong><em>share</em></strong> the results in R plot form. Finally, I <strong><em>acted</em></strong> by giving a conclusion and recommendations for stakeholder deliverables. 

# Tableau
After building my R analysis, I still wanted to create some Tableau data visualizations. It turned out to be a good exercise in thinking about how else I could extract more data insights. My Tableau results are clearly simpler, but they still give a new understanding, and in turn, I'm glad I gave extra effort to bring out my current best.
